    "text": "Indexing\nOne of the most useful tools we will use is indexing and index notation. An index is essentially a numerical representation of an item’s position in a list or vector. It is typically an integer, starting from either 0 or 1 depending on the programming language. In R, our index positions always start at 1.\nFor example, in the word “learning”, the l is at index 1. Similarly, in the following vector of numbers – \\((10, 11, 12)\\) – the value at index 1 is 10. We can confirm this with code:"
