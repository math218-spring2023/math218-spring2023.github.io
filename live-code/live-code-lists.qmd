### Data

```{r message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)
data(mite)
data(mite.env)
mite_dat <- mite.env %>%
  add_column(abundance = mite$LRUG)
```

## Lists

Lists are simply another data object in R. List can hold elements of different types, such as vectors, strings, and numbers, and even more lists! We create a list using the `list()` function.

```{r}
my_list <- list("stat", c(2,1,8))

```

This produces the following result:

```{r}
my_list
```

That's great! Lists behave similar to, but not exactly like, vectors. You can find the length of the vector:

```{r}
length(my_list)
```

Also, it would be extremely useful to be able to access each element of `my_list`. However, if we were to use the usual `[ ]` notation to index, notice what happens:

```{r}
my_list[2]
```

This output isn't a vector; it's still a list, so I cannot do math on it! The following code wouldn't work:

```{r}
#| eval: false
2 * my_list[2]
```

Instead, to access each item in a list, we need to use double brackets, i.e. `[[ ]]`:

```{r}
my_list[[2]]
```

Now we can work with the vector as normal

```{r}
2 * my_list[[2]]
```

Storing items into lists will also require the double brackets. For example,

```{r}
my_list[[3]] <- 5
my_list
```

Why are we working with lists? We'll need them for k-fold CV! 

## apply()

A useful function is the `apply()` function, which applies the same function to either ALL the rows or ALL the columns. It takes three arguments: what R object you want to apply the function two, by row (1) or by column (2), and the function itself.

In the following code, I am applying the mean function to each column of `dat`. Notice that I get back a vector of column means!

```{r}
dat <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = 11:20)
apply(dat, 2, mean)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
n <- nrow(mite_dat)
k <- 5
set.seed(7)
# the following creates a list
fold_ids <- split(sample(1:n), ceiling(seq_along(1:n)/(n/k)))
true_y <- mite_dat$abundance
errs <- rep(NA, k)
for(i in 1:k){
  # to access list elements, use double brackets
  test_fold_ids <- fold_ids[[i]]
  mod <- lm(abundance ~ WatrCont + SubsDens, data = mite_dat[-test_fold_ids,])
  pred <- predict(mod, newdata = mite_dat[test_fold_ids,])
  errs[i] <- get_rmse(true_y[test_fold_ids], pred) 
}
kfold_err <- mean(errs)
```
